# Review Protocol: Cloud-Fog Computing Architecture for Real-Time Digital Twins

# Review Protocol 

## Research Questions 
- RQ1: How do cloud-fog architectures reduce latency in real-time DTs? (Causal, PICO: Population=DT systems; Intervention=Cloud-fog; Comparison=Cloud-only; Outcome=Response time).

## Search Strategy 
- Sources: Ref   Özkan (30 papers), databases: IEEE, Scopus.
- Strings: "digital twin" AND ("cloud" OR "fog" OR "edge") AND "real-time".

## Inclusion/Exclusion 
- Inclusion: Empirical studies on DT with distributed arch, latency metrics.
- Exclusion: Non-English, pre-2010, non-peer-reviewed (nhưng include preprint nếu relevant).

## Quality Assessment 
- Checklist: CRD-based (11 questions, score 0-1).
- Hierarchy: Quasi-experiment (simulation-based) = medium.

## Data Extraction Form 
- Fields: Study ID, Authors, Year, Methods, Results (latency %), Conclusions.

## Synthesis 
- Narrative + Quantitative
