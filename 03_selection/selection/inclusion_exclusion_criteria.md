# Inclusion/Exclusion for Study 08 

## Criteria 

- Inclusion: The paper discusses DT in a distributed environment (cloud-fog), empirical (experiments), and latency/real-time measurement.

- Exclusion: Not SE/IoT, lacks methods/results.
## Process 

- Abstract reading: Relevant (cloud-fog for real-time DT).

- Full reading: Empirical (simulations with MQTT, latency reduced by 54-64%).

- Reliability : Kappa=1 (single reviewer, assume good).

Conclusion: INCLUDED (suitable for RQ, hierarchy: Quasi-experiment).
